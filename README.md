# Spaceship-Badge

The CodeMash 2022 Spaceship Badge is great little souvenir and conversation starter that also serves
as an easy introduction to surface mount soldering and the endless possibilities of the 555 timer.

It consists of 2 main components: a battery-powered spaceship badge and an add-on alien. They are
connected via SAO V1.69BIS standard 6-pin connectors, so other SAO boards will work with the
badge as well.
